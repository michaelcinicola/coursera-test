<body>
<div>3 Characters you should always escape</div>
<div>&lt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&amp;</div>
<div>This is a test &amp;lt;</div>
<div>Also remember additional entities</div>
<div>&copy;</div>
<div>And the proper use of this next one is not for adding extra spaces (whoopsie!) but for keeping a phrase&nbsp;like&nbsp;this together and not allowing it to break during the resize of an element or a browser.</div>
<div>And finally, using the quote entitiy will really make sure previous, less robust character sets, often found in html emails, will still display &quot;quotes&quot; instead of odd characters as a replacement. They may not look as good as the curly ones, but they are more reliable to appear.
