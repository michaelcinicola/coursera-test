    <div>Div is the most common Block-level element. Blocks render to begin on a new line by default.</div>
    <span>Span is the most common Inline-level element. Spans render to begin on the same line by default.</span>
    <div>Div 1 = new line</div>
    <div>Div 2 = new line</div>
    <span>Span 1 = same line (in-line) BUT the Div above it has a behavior that renders itself on its own line, pushing the span down a line.</span>
    <div>Div 3 = new line (despite following a span) <span>Span 2 = In-line BECAUSE this span is inside the div before the div is closed. So no pushing the span down a line this time.</span><a href="www.apple.com">Hi</a></div>
